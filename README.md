# colorconsole-snake
A snake game written with my Colorconsole library and the keyboard library.

## Installation

1. `pip install` the [`keyboard`](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/) module with `pip install keyboard`
2. Download the [`colorconsole` Module written by me](https://github.com/asherhe/python-colorconsole) and put it somewhere.
3. Download the snake game from this repository, and put it where you put `colorconsole.py`
4. Run the game!

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys to move the snake. Eat the red stuff (which is food), and try to not eat yourself or the borders.
